# 0001. Secure Secret Management

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Applications often require access to sensitive information such as database credentials, API keys, third-party service tokens, and cryptographic keys. Storing these "secrets" securely is critical to prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and compliance violations. Common insecure practices include hardcoding secrets directly into source code, storing them in plain text configuration files, or committing them to version control systems.

These practices lead to:
*   **Security Risks**: Secrets can be easily exposed if the codebase is compromised or accessed by unauthorized individuals.
*   **Operational Overhead**: Manual rotation of secrets is cumbersome and error-prone.
*   **Lack of Auditability**: Difficult to track who accessed which secret and when.
*   **Environment-Specific Challenges**: Managing different secrets for development, staging, and production environments becomes complex.

We need a robust, scalable, and secure solution for managing secrets across all environments.

## Decision
We will implement a multi-tiered approach to secret management:

1.  **Production and Staging Environments**: For production and staging deployments, we will leverage **Cloud-Native Secret Managers** (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, Google Secret Manager, depending on our primary cloud provider). These services provide secure storage, automatic rotation capabilities, fine-grained access control (IAM integration), auditing, and seamless integration with cloud services.

2.  **Development and CI/CD Environments**: For local development and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, we will primarily use **Environment Variables**. Secrets will be injected into the application runtime via environment variables. For CI/CD, these variables will be securely managed by the CI/CD platform's built-in secret management features (e.g., GitHub Actions Secrets, GitLab CI/CD Variables, Jenkins Credentials).

3.  **No Hardcoding**: Under no circumstances will secrets be hardcoded into the application source code or committed to version control.

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Hardcoding Secrets in Source Code
*   **Pros**: Simplest to implement initially.
*   **Cons**: Extremely insecure, high risk of exposure, difficult to rotate, no auditability, violates security best practices.

### 2. Plain Text Configuration Files
*   **Pros**: Separates secrets from code.
*   **Cons**: Secrets are still stored in plain text, vulnerable to file system access, difficult to manage across environments, no auditability.

### 3. Encrypted Configuration Files (e.g., using `git-secret`, `ansible-vault`)
*   **Pros**: Secrets are encrypted at rest, can be version controlled (encrypted form).
*   **Cons**: Requires managing encryption keys, adds complexity to deployment and development workflows, key distribution challenges, less dynamic than secret managers.

### 4. Dedicated Secret Management Tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault)
*   **Pros**: Highly secure, robust, supports dynamic secrets, multi-cloud/hybrid-cloud capabilities, strong auditing.
*   **Cons**: Significant operational overhead, requires dedicated infrastructure and expertise to set up and maintain, higher complexity for smaller projects.

## Consequences

### Positive
*   **Enhanced Security**: Secrets are stored securely, encrypted at rest and in transit, and accessed with appropriate permissions.
*   **Reduced Risk of Exposure**: Eliminates hardcoded secrets and plain text storage, significantly lowering the risk of accidental leakage.
*   **Improved Compliance**: Easier to meet regulatory requirements for data protection and access control.
*   **Simplified Rotation**: Cloud secret managers offer automated secret rotation, reducing manual effort and improving security posture.
*   **Auditability**: Access to secrets is logged and auditable, providing a clear trail of usage.
*   **Environment Isolation**: Different secrets can be easily managed for different environments without cross-contamination.

### Negative
*   **Increased Complexity**: Introduces new services and concepts, requiring developers and operations teams to learn new tools and workflows.
*   **Cloud Vendor Lock-in (for production)**: Relying on a specific cloud provider's secret manager ties us to that ecosystem for production deployments.
*   **Development Workflow Changes**: Developers must adapt to fetching secrets from environment variables or local secret stores rather than local config files.
*   **Potential Cost**: Cloud secret management services may incur costs based on usage.

This decision provides a strong balance between security, operational efficiency, and ease of integration for our current needs, while allowing for future migration to more advanced dedicated tools like HashiCorp Vault if multi-cloud or hybrid-cloud requirements become more stringent.
